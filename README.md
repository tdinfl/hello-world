# hello-world
My hello-world repository is a place where I store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
I work for the government in Tampa, FL where I am responsible for researching and executing new ways for us to do business faster and more effectively.  As a part of that, I sponsor and participate in hackathons, tech sprints, and other open development venues.  Accordingly, I wanted to better understand Github and some of the other tools that support the community.
